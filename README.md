# DC Circuit Analyzer
Analyzes arbitrary electronic circuits consisting of resistors, current sources and voltage sources by constructing a graph out of them and applying Kirchoff's laws. Done as a Physics C yearly homework project.

Features:
- Calculates the equivalent resistance and voltage difference between any two points
- Determines the amount of current going through any component
- Has a graphical UI for inputting the circuit which shows the step-by-step process of the underlying algorithm
